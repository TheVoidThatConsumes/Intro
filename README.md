Hello, I am David Obi.

I am an intermediate frontend developer with ~2 years of cumulative experience and a freelance
writer with ~5 years experience. I am adept at contributing to a highly collaborative work
environment and passionate about writing clean, efficient and maintainable code. I am also a huge
fan of animated web pages and out-of-the-box creative designs, and you will mostly find me on
Awwwards or Youtube, going through and studying other peopleâ€™s websites as a source of
inspiration.

I am into:
* Continuous learning
* Planning
* Creative thought processes
* Adapting to change
           
I use the following technologies to work behind the scenes:
* HTML5/CSS3
* TailwindCSS
* JavaScript/JQuery
* GSAP and React.js (Currently learning)
           
I have built several portfolio-worthy projects that I translated to code by studying the designs from
Figma/Dribble. They are as follows:
